# FiftyOne Brain: Production/Marketing

Tools for generating marketing material across the FiftyOne project.

This provides information on generating repeatable marketing material backed by
the code. Things like graphs, screen-shots, etc. This is in `fiftyone-brain`
instead of `fiftyone` because it may reference experiment details with
proprietary information that only exists in the brain.
